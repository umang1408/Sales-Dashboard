# Sales-Dashboard (Microsoft excel, Power Bi)
Developed a highly comprehensive sales dashboard for ABC Limited company for financial year 2021-22

• It utilises the sales dataset from Kaggle, which includes data on the total sales, gross margin, BtoB/BtoC buisness,product code and many more

• In order to gain various insights, data was imported from excel to Power Bi

• The power of Power BI allow the company officials to explore data by drilling down into specific location, year, product code, and other factors. In this dashboard, I have also used decomposition tree and Q & A AI visuals present under the INSERT tab of Power Bi.
